<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<p>The mouthwatering mix of tender noodles, delicious basil pesto, tangy feta and all the veggies is a winning flavor combination sure to impress your family and friends. Here’s everything you’ll need to make this pesto pasta recipe:</p>

<ul>
<li>Pasta. Any type of pasta works well. Rigatoni, penne, fusilli, rotini, spaghetti, elbows and farfalle (also known as bowtie pasta) are good options. To make this recipe gluten free, use a gluten-free pasta.</li>

<li>Basil pesto. Homemade pesto or store-bought, if you want to save some time. My favorite store-bought pesto is Kirkland from Costco. Tastes like fresh pesto and the bright color can’t be beat!</li>

<li>Black olives. Add a delicious salty, savory taste. Any olive will work nicely — use your favorite. Kalamata olives are a great alternative option and if you’re not a fan, simply omit.</li>

<li>Feta cheese. This salty addition pulls everything together in this salad. If you have the choice between buying a block or crumbled feta at your grocery store, always stick with the block. The containers of crumbled feta typically have powdered cellulose, which causes the feta to be harder and taste a bit drier. (It also results in shorter shelf life.) Here are some tips for navigating supermarket feta cheese.</li>

<li>Cherry tomatoes. While any tomatoes will work, we love the sweetness and juiciness of cherry or grape tomatoes. Quarter large cherry tomatoes or halve smaller ones.</li>

<li>Fresh basil leaves. Optional, for garnish. You could also garnish with fresh parsley.</li>
</ul>
    

<h2><strong>Steps</strong></h2>
    <ol> 
        <li><p>Cook pasta. Boil the pasta according to package directions in a large pot of salted water until al dente.</p></li>
        <li><p>Chop the veggies. While the pasta is cooking, chop the tomatoes and prepare the other ingredients. This keeps things moving quick and decreases prep time. You’ll have this whole salad ready to go in mere minutes, which is pretty awesome considering it can last in the fridge for about 5 days!</p></li>
        <li><p>Toss all ingredients. Once the pasta has cooked, drain it and run it under cold water to quickly cool it off. Then, place all of the ingredients along with the drained pasta in a large bowl. Toss with the pesto until all ingredients are well coated. Taste and add salt, if needed. With the saltiness of the pesto sauce and feta, we usually don’t need to add salt.</p></li> 
        <li><p>Serve. You can serve this at room temperature or chilled. To chill, refrigerate for at least 2 hours before serving. Garnish with fresh basil and crumbled feta cheese and enjoy! You can also add a squeeze of fresh lemon juice for brightness and/or a sprinkle of red pepper flakes for a little spice.</p></li>
